### About
A simple web application that makes it easier for the students as well as the employers to simplify the internship hiring process. 

The students can register and apply for internships through the portal provided exclusively for the students. Also, they will be able to verify 
if they have been selected for the next round or not.

The employers, once registered through the portal (exclusively for the employers) can view all the 
registered students, download their resumes and shortlist them based on the required criteria. 
If required, they can remove them from the list as well.

Thus, it becomes simple for the university to keep track of the students as well as the participating companies and simplify the recruitment process.

### Modules

#### 1. The Student Module 
This module has everything to do with the student’s registration and details
First, every student makes their own profile by filling up the student’s registration form. 
This form includes their details like their registration number, their area of speciality, resume upload option and so on. 
Students are simultaneously creating an account while doing so.

Then, with the newly created account students can login to their dashboard through the student login. 
They will be presented with and have access to various options such as:
●	Edit Profile, where they can update the details, they’ve entered during registration and also upload their latest Resume, if need be.
●	Delete Record, to remove their name from the list of students who have registered for the internship.
●	Check Selection, to check whether they have been shortlisted for an internship call by a specific company.
●	View Student’s List, to view all the other student’s from the university that have applied for internships.
●	Update Password, to change their password.

#### 2. The Employer Module 
This module has everything to do with the Employer's details and their accesses.
As seen in the student module, Employers have to make their own account by completing the registration form that asks for their Company Name, ID and 
official company email ID along with a password. This will be used as their account.
Using these new credentials, the Employer can access their dashboard through the Employer Login.

The features/access of an Employer’s dashboard are:
●	Shortlist Students, where they can search for students based on their CGPA and speciality criteria and subsequently shortlist them for internship if deemed eligible. They will be able to see the student’s details and download/view their Resume and subsequently shortlist them for internship if deemed eligible. 
●	View Shortlisted Students, shows a list of all the students that have been shortlisted for the next round by them.
