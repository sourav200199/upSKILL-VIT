### About
A simple web application that makes it easier for the students as well as the employers to simplify the internship hiring process. 

The students can register and apply for internships through the portal provided exclusively for the students. Also, they will be able to verify 
if they have been selected for the next round or not.

The employers, once registered through the portal (exclusively for the employers) can view all the 
registered students, download their resumes and shortlist them based on the required criteria. 
If required, they can remove them from the list as well.

Thus, it becomes simple for the university to keep track of the students as well as the participating companies and simplify the recruitment process.
